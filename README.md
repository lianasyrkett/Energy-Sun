Energy-Sun

This application is basically a form that asks the user to enter how many hours a day they use particular electronics. Then using hard-coded values for the kwH cost of each appliance, (easily found on Google) you can just get the monetary cost of using each appliance, add them all up, and tell the user how much they spend a day on electricity.
